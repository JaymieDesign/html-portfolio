<p>
  Hey there. I am Jaymie, a junior web developer by the time i'll be posting this, but an advanced coder by the time
  you'll be viewing this.
</p>

<p>
  I took an interest in coding after seeing how endless the opportunities are in self development. What better
  ay to stast than with web development, slowly rising up the ranks to what i presume will be a horizon worth reaching.
</p>

<p>For now, its a bargain on time well spent. Want to hire my skills, visit my about page for more relevant information.</p>
