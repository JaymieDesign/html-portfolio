    <hr />
    <p>
        My name is Jaymie Muigai, a man of Kenyan residence. I'm an ambitious character, with a relentless heart and a man with God fearing roots. 
        I'm 20 years of age as of the time of making this resume. I am an undergraduate student at the prestine university of JKUAT. I'm close on 2 years in the field of journalism and it's an enthrilling experience.
         My passion is to bring back the respect to the practice of journalism, with the help of evolving tech. I believe that it has a role to play in our day to day lives and hence birthing my drive towards this journey. I believe in the power within stories, to drive and shape the views of people.
        I also believe in the aspect of talent, hence my enthusiasm in the field of programing. I'd want to harness the capabilities of this skill so as to output notable progress.
        My goal in life is simple, to shape a future worth looking forward to for a community worth striving for.

        my skills in article typewritting, communication as well as crisis management. Moreso, I've been engaged wihth the Catalyse platform under the NGo, OneHope as an intern under their Junior Web Development 
        post. I can confidently say that my skills in programing are constantly on the test here. Other than my experience in task oriented fields, i've also been able to engage in the church spectrum as a videographer
        and web designer at the Apostolic Faith Church Kenya. It's been 2 years in progress. I am also a content creator, at the youtube platform, focusing on showcasing talent in music and also storytelling. Lastly, 
        I've been a graphics designer for close on 6 months now, focused on the fashion enthusists.
